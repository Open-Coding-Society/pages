Title: "Applying Object-Based Game Mechanics"
Description: "This module introduces the OCS GameEngine and its core mechanics using GameBuilder. Learners explore key objects including Backgrounds, Characters, and Barriers while developing foundational understanding of object properties, interactions, and system behavior. This lesson prepares students to begin designing and implementing their own interactive games within the GameEngine environment."

    keyPoints:
      - "Game Loop Logic"
      - "Game Objects"
      - "Properties and Updates"
      - "Interactions and Reactions"
      - "Files and Directories"
    subtitle: "Engine Architecture and Mechanics"
    description: "This guide introduces the core architecture of the GameEngine, including the game loop, object lifecycle, interactions, and reaction behaviors. It provides a system-level overview of how objects update, respond, and interact within the engine runtime environment."

  - title: "GameBuilder"

    alt: "GameBuilder Interface"
    keyPoints:
      - "Visual Design"
      - "Backgrounds and Characters"
      - "Objects and Interactions"
      - "Property Configuration and Editing"
    subtitle: "Interactive Game Creation Tool"
    description: "GameBuilder provides a visual interface for configuring game assets and object properties. Learners begin with an asset panel, generate a structured game environment, and incrementally refine mechanics and execute the game using CodeRunner to observe system behavior in real time."
  
  - title: "Work and Submission Guide"

    alt: "GameEngine File Structure, Work, and Submission"
    keyPoints:
      - "12-Week Template/Group Repository"
      - "Daily Game Development Workflow"
      - "GameBuilder Asset Configuration"
      - "Issue Tracking and Kanban"
      - "Instructor Fork Repository"
      - "Instructor-Directed Pull Requests"
    subtitle: "Structured Development and Selective PR(s)"
    description: "Students develop their game within a shared template/group repository used throughout the 12-week course. Daily commits, feature development, and asset updates occur within this primary repository. When instructor review or integration is required, students maintain a separate fork repository containing only selected artifacts. Pull Requests are submitted from this fork to support structured, instructor-directed integration of GameBuilder configuration files and assets for this module."
