      - "Backend schema proposal"
      - "Planned analytics integration"
    subtitle: "Integrated Messaging for OCS"
    description: "Student collaboration on OCS is fragmented and largely occurs off-platform (e.g., Discord, text, email). This reduces visibility into group participation, limits actionable feedback, and weakens learning-aligned collaboration. An initial groups feature lacked persistent messaging, backend structure, and analytics, resulting in limited adoption."
