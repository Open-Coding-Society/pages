## A. Unit Description

**1. Topic of the Unit:**  
Crash Course on Building a Flask Web Server (with progressive, interactive steps)

**2. Purpose of the Unit**  
To introduce students to backend web development using Flask, guiding them from basic server setup to a full-stack application with persistent storage, user authentication, and interactive frontend features.

**3. Subject and Grade:**  
Computer Science, Grades 10–12

**4. Overview of In-Person Delivery:**  

- Teacher-led demonstrations of Flask server setup and coding
- Students follow along on their own devices, building each component step-by-step
- Peer collaboration and live troubleshooting occurs during demonstration
- Formative checkpoints and group discussions after each major milestone

## B. Standards-Based Evaluation & Improvements

### 1. Standard B: Content, Indicator B3

**Digital literacy and communication skills are incorporated and taught as an integral part of the curriculum.**

a. **Current Alignment:**  

- In-person, students practice digital literacy by using command-line tools, GitHub, and VS Code, but communication is mostly verbal or via in-class collaboration.
- *Example:* Students clone a repo and run Flask locally, but may not document their process or communicate progress online.

b. **Improvement for E-Learning:**  

- Integrate digital communication by requiring students to document progress in GitHub Issues, use Pull Requests (PRs) for code review, and participate in online discussion microblog.

c. **Supporting Tool:**  

- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for asynchronous communication and digital literacy practice.

### 2. Standard C: Instructional Design, Indicator C8

**The course design provides opportunities for learner-instructor interaction, including opportunities for regular feedback about learner progress.**

a. **Current Alignment:**  

- In-person, feedback is immediate and informal during coding sessions.
- *Example:* Teacher and Teacher Aide circulates and gives real-time help until table teams have ability to progress independently.

b. **Improvement for E-Learning:**  

- Use formative checkpoints in the Jupyter notebook, with students submitting screenshots or code snippets for feedback.
- Schedule regular virtual check-ins or feedback sessions.

c. **Supporting Tool:**  

- Jupyter Notebooks with embedded formative tasks and feedback comments.

### 3. Standard D: Learner Assessment, Indicator D3

**Assessment practices provide frequent and varied opportunities for self-monitoring and reflection of learning.**

a. **Current Alignment:**  

- In-person, students reflect verbally or in journals, but not always consistently.
- *Example:* End-of-lesson reflections or group discussions/checkpoints.

b. **Improvement for E-Learning:**  

- Add self-check quizzes, reflection prompts, and peer review tasks in the notebook and on GitHub.

c. **Supporting Tool:**  

- Embedded Microblog Forms or Jupyter notebook markdown cells for reflection and self-assessment.

---

### 4. Standard F: Course Technology, Indicator F3

**The course technology allows for customization and personalization.**

a. **Current Alignment:**  

- In-person, students can choose project topics but follow the same technical steps.
- *Example:* All students build the same basic Flask app, but build or adapt APIs to meet their prototype Digital Famine or West Coast Quest frontend.

b. **Improvement for E-Learning:**  

- Allow students to personalize their Flask project (e.g., custom API themes, unique endpoints, or UI tweaks).

c. **Supporting Tool:**  

- GitHub branching and project templates, allowing students to fork and customize their own version.

---

### 5. Additional Standard (e.g., Standard E: Accessibility, Indicator E2)

**The course provides alternative means of access to course materials.**

a. **Current Alignment:**  

- In-person, teacher provides help as needed, but materials may not be accessible to all learners.

b. **Improvement for E-Learning:**  

- Ensure all instructions, code, and resources are available in accessible formats (e.g., alt text for images, captions for videos, readable markdown).

c. **Supporting Tool:**  

- Use of accessible Jupyter Notebooks and adherence to web accessibility guidelines.

## C. Next Steps

- Build out each lesson step in the notebook, with formative tasks and checkpoints.
- Use infographics and visual guides to scaffold learning.
- Integrate digital communication and reflection at each stage.
- Provide opportunities for personalization and self-assessment.
