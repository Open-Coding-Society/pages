## Why Flask and Backend Matter

Flask gives you the essentials to get started, allowing you to add only the backend features you need (it’s lightweight)—such as API request handling. It’s beginner-friendly, widely used in the industry, and perfect for learning how the backend of a website works. With Flask, you’ll quickly go from writing simple scripts to powering dynamic, data-driven web apps.
