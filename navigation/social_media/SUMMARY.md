# ✅ Flask Backend for Social Media - COMPLETE

## 🎉 What Was Created

You now have a **complete Python/Flask backend** for your social media system that replaces the Java backend!

## 📦 Files Created (7 new files)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`model_post.py`** | ✅ SQLAlchemy database model for posts and replies |
| **`api_post.py`** | ✅ Flask REST API with all endpoints |
| **`init_posts.py`** | ✅ Database initialization script |
| `FLASK_README.md` | 📖 Complete overview and feature list |
| `FLASK_BACKEND_SETUP.md` | 📖 Detailed setup instructions |
| `COPY_THESE_FILES.md` | 📖 Quick copy commands reference |
| `SUMMARY.md` | 📖 This file |

## ✅ What Was Removed

- ❌ Deleted: `BACKEND_Post.java` (removed from git)
- ❌ Deleted: `BACKEND_PostApiController.java` (removed from git)
- ❌ Deleted: `BACKEND_PostJpaRepository.java` (removed from git)

These Java files are no longer needed since you're using Flask/Python!

## 🚀 Next Steps (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Copy Backend Files

Copy these 3 files to your Flask backend repository:

```bash
# Example if your backend is at ~/flaskbackend
cd ~/flaskbackend

cp ~/pages/navigation/social_media/model_post.py model/post.py
cp ~/pages/navigation/social_media/api_post.py api/post.py
cp ~/pages/navigation/social_media/init_posts.py scripts/init_posts.py
chmod +x scripts/init_posts.py
```

**See `COPY_THESE_FILES.md` for detailed copy instructions.**

### Step 2: Register the API

Edit your backend's `main.py`:

```python
from api.post import post_api  # Add this import

# ... in your app setup ...

app.register_blueprint(post_api)  # Add this line
```

### Step 3: Initialize Database

```bash
cd ~/flaskbackend
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/init_posts.py
```

**That's it!** Your backend is ready. Start it with:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🎯 What the Backend Does

### API Endpoints Provided

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| `/api/post` | POST | Create a post | ✅ |
| `/api/post/all` | GET | Get all posts | ✅ |
| `/api/post/page?url=...` | GET | Get posts for a page | ❌ |
| `/api/post/{id}` | GET | Get specific post | ✅ |
| `/api/post/{id}` | PUT | Update your post | ✅ |
| `/api/post/{id}` | DELETE | Delete your post | ✅ |
| `/api/post/reply` | POST | Reply to a post | ✅ |
| `/api/post/user/{id}` | GET | Get user's posts | ✅ |

### Features

- ✅ JWT authentication (integrates with your existing auth system)
- ✅ Create posts with optional grades
- ✅ Threaded replies (comments on comments)
- ✅ Persistent database storage (SQLite or MySQL)
- ✅ Auto-attribution to logged-in user
- ✅ Edit and delete your own posts
- ✅ View posts by lesson/page
- ✅ Full CRUD operations

## 📱 Frontend Integration

Your frontend is **already configured** and ready to use!

### Pages Available

1. **`/social-media`** (`post.md`)
   - Create new posts
   - View your feed
   - Reply to posts
   - Two tabs: Create and Feed

2. **`/social-feed`** (`feed.md`)
   - Browse all posts from all users
   - Search and filter
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
   - Reply to anyone's posts

### How Login Works

```
User logs in → JWT cookie set
    ↓
User creates post → Backend reads JWT → Gets user info
    ↓
Post saved with user ID → Shows user's name on post
    ↓
All users can see the post in the feed
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Backend is Running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8887/api/post/all
```

Should return: `{"message": "Token is missing"}` or a list of posts

### Test 2: Login and Create Post

1. Start frontend: `cd ~/pages && make`
2. Open: `http://localhost:4100/login`
3. Login with your test account
4. Go to: `http://localhost:4100/social-media`
5. Create a post
6. Switch to "View Feed" tab
7. See your post!

### Test 3: View Social Feed

1. Go to: `http://localhost:4100/social-feed`
2. Should see all posts
3. Try searching/filtering
4. Reply to a post

## 📊 Database Schema

### Posts Table Structure

```
posts
├── id (PRIMARY KEY)
├── _user_id (FOREIGN KEY → users.id)
├── _parent_id (FOREIGN KEY → posts.id, for replies)
├── _content (TEXT, the post content)
├── _grade_received (VARCHAR, optional grade like "A+")
├── _page_url (VARCHAR, lesson URL)
├── _page_title (VARCHAR, lesson title)
├── _timestamp (DATETIME, when created)
└── _updated_at (DATETIME, when updated)
```

### Relationships

- Each **Post** belongs to a **User**
- Each **Post** can have many **Replies** (child posts)
- Each **Reply** has a **Parent Post**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No module named 'model.post'"

**Solution:** Copy `model_post.py` to your backend's `model/post.py`

### Problem: "Table posts doesn't exist"

**Solution:** Run `python scripts/init_posts.py`

### Problem: "401 Unauthorized"

**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in. Check that JWT cookie is being sent.

### Problem: Posts not showing up

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running
3. Check `config.js` has correct backend URL
4. Make sure you're logged in

### Problem: CORS errors

**Solution:** Enable CORS in your Flask app:
```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app, supports_credentials=True)
```

## ✨ Key Differences from Java Backend

### Before (Java/Spring Boot)
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/post")
public class PostApiController {
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Post> createPost(@RequestBody Post post) {
        // Java code...
    }
}
```

### Now (Python/Flask)
```python
class PostAPI(Resource):
    @token_required()
    def post(self):
        # Get current user from JWT
        current_user = g.current_user
        # Create post...
        return created_post.read(), 201
```

### Benefits of Flask Version
- ✅ Consistent with your existing Flask backend
- ✅ Python syntax (easier for CSP students)
- ✅ Integrated with your existing JWT auth
- ✅ Uses your existing User model
- ✅ Same database (SQLite/MySQL)
- ✅ No need to run Java and Python servers

## 🎓 Student Experience

### What Students Can Do

1. **Login** to the site
2. **Create posts** about what they're learning
3. **Add grades** to posts (optional)
4. **See everyone's posts** in the social feed
5. **Reply** to posts (threaded comments)
6. **Search and filter** posts
7. **Update/delete** their own posts

### Example Workflow

```
Student A logs in
    → Creates post: "Just finished Flask tutorial! Got an A!"
    → Post appears in social feed

Student B sees post in feed
    → Replies: "Great work! How did you handle JWT?"
    
Student A sees reply
    → Replies back: "Used the @token_required decorator!"
    
Teacher sees all posts
    → Can see who's engaged
    → Can reply with feedback
```
