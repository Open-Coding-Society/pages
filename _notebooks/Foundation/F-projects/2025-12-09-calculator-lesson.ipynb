    "## Build Your First Calculator: A Guided Frontend Project\n",
    "\n",
    "A calculator is the perfect project to practice the core trio of web development: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. We will focus on building the initial structure and implementing the three essential functions: **Addition (+)**, **Equals (=)**, and **Clear (AC)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will understand **DOM structure**, **CSS Grid**, **Event Delegation**, and **State Management**—the fundamental concepts of frontend application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. HTML: Structuring the Calculator (The Skeleton)\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML defines the elements the user sees: the screen and the buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Containers and Display\n",
    "\n",
    "We need three main nested \\`div\\` elements to organize the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element | Class/ID | Purpose |\n",
    "|---------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| \\`div\\` | \\`class=\"calculator\"\\` | The main wrapper for all content. |\n",
    "| \\`div\\` | \\`id=\"display\"\\` | The screen we will manipulate with JavaScript. |\n",
    "| \\`div\\` | \\`class=\"keys\"\\` | The container for all buttons, which we will turn into a Grid in CSS. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Write the HTML for these three nested \\`div\\` elements.\n",
    "- Set the initial text content of the \\`#display\\` element to \\`0\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Adding the Essential Buttons\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add all the number buttons, the decimal point, and the three required action buttons: **AC**, **+**, and **=**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept: data-action Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "For buttons that perform a function (not just display a number), we use a special HTML attribute starting with \\`data-\\`. JavaScript will read this attribute to know what the button does.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Button Text | data-action Value |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| AC | \\`\"clear\"\\` |\n",
    "| + | \\`\"add\"\\` |\n",
    "| = | \\`\"equals\"\\` |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Inside your \\`<div class=\"keys\">\\`, add all number buttons (0 through 9) and the decimal (\\`.\\`).\n",
    "- Add the **AC**, **+**, and **=** buttons, making sure to include the corresponding \\`data-action\\` attributes from the table above.\n",
    "- Organize your buttons in a way that resembles a standard calculator layout (rows of four).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. CSS: Styling the Grid (The Look)\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS makes the calculator visually appealing and, most importantly, arranges the buttons using the powerful **CSS Grid** system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Defining the Grid and Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the \\`.keys\\` container to arrange all the buttons into a neat 4 × 5 grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key CSS Concept: Grid Layout**\n",
    "- \\`display: grid;\\` enables the grid container.\n",
    "- \\`grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);\\` creates four equal-width columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Write the CSS to apply the two key grid properties listed above to the \\`.keys\\` class.\n",
    "- Add a \\`gap: 10px;\\` property to put spacing between the buttons.\n",
    "- Write basic styles for the \\`button\\` elements (e.g., \\`padding\\`, \\`font-size\\`, \\`background-color\\`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "- Experiment with different padding and font-size values to make buttons feel comfortable to click.\n",
    "- Try a dark background color like \\`#333\\` for buttons and light text like \\`#fff\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Styling the App and Display\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the visual design by styling the main container and the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Style the \\`#display\\` element: give it a dark background, white text, large \\`font-size\\`, and use \\`text-align: right;\\` so the numbers align correctly.\n",
    "- Style the \\`.calculator\\` to give it a fixed width and a dark background.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** To make the \\`0\\` button wider, you can add a class to that button in your HTML (e.g., \\`<button class=\"zero\">0</button>\\`) and then use CSS to make that class span two columns: \\`grid-column: span 2;\\`. Implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. JavaScript: Adding Behavior (The Brain)\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript handles button clicks, manages the state of the calculation, and performs the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5: State Management and Event Delegation\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculator needs to remember the steps of the calculation. This is handled by global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept: State Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Initial Value | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------|---------------|---------|\n",
    "| \\`firstValue\\` | \\`null\\` | Stores the first number (e.g., \\`100\\` in \\`100 + 5\\`). |\n",
    "| \\`operator\\` | \\`null\\` | Stores the operation string (e.g., \\`'add'\\`). |\n",
    "| \\`waitingForSecond\\` | \\`false\\` | A flag: is the calculator waiting for the user to start typing the second number? |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Select the display element and the keys container using \\`document.getElementById\\` and \\`document.querySelector\\`.\n",
    "- Define the three state variables listed above and set their initial values.\n",
    "- Attach a single \\`'click'\\` event listener to the keys container. This is **Event Delegation**.\n",
    "- Inside the listener, get the clicked element's \\`data-action\\` into an \\`action\\` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 6: Handling Number Input\n",
    "\n",
    "If a button has no \\`data-action\\` (it's a number), we update the display.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Create an \\`if\\` block that runs only if the \\`action\\` variable is empty/undefined.\n",
    "- Inside this block, write the logic to append the new digit to the current display text.\n",
    "- Add logic to ensure that if the display shows only \\`'0'\\`, the first digit pressed replaces the \\`'0'\\` instead of appending to it (e.g., \\`07\\` is bad, \\`7\\` is good).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 7: The Math Function (operate)\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function to handle the math separately. For now, it only needs to handle addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Define a function called \\`operate(a, op, b)\\` that takes three arguments.\n",
    "- Use \\`if\\` statements to check if the \\`op\\` argument equals \\`'add'\\`.\n",
    "- If it does, return the sum of \\`a\\` and \\`b\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 8: Implementing the Addition (+) Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "When the + button is clicked, we store the current display number and the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Create an \\`if\\` block that runs when \\`action === 'add'\\`.\n",
    "- Convert the number currently on the display (a string) into a float/number and store it in your \\`firstValue\\` variable.\n",
    "- Set the \\`operator\\` variable to \\`'add'\\`.\n",
    "- Set the \\`waitingForSecond\\` flag to \\`true\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 9: Implementing the Equals (=) Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "This executes the full calculation and resets the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an \\`if\\` block that runs when \\`action === 'equals'\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, check that both \\`firstValue\\` and \\`operator\\` are not \\`null\\`. If either is missing, the user can't calculate yet, so \\`return\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get the current display number (the second operand).\n",
    "- Call your \\`operate\\` function with \\`firstValue\\`, \\`operator\\`, and the second operand.\n",
    "- Set \\`display.textContent\\` to the result.\n",
    "- Finally, reset the three state variables to their initial \\`null\\`/\\`false\\` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 10: Implementing the Clear (AC) Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "This function clears the display and resets the calculator's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code Task:**\n",
    "- Create an \\`if\\` block that runs when \\`action === 'clear'\\`.\n",
    "- Set \\`display.textContent\\` back to \\`'0'\\`.\n",
    "- Reset all three state variables (\\`firstValue\\`, \\`operator\\`, \\`waitingForSecond\\`) to their initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Your calculator can currently only add! Use the logic patterns you just learned to expand its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiply and Divide\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add buttons for multiplication and division to your HTML.\n",
    "- Update your JavaScript \\`operate\\` function to handle these new actions.\n",
    "- Test: \\`4 × 5 =\\` should show \\`20\\`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom-Made Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add your own button that performs a complicated function on the number\n",
    "- The function can be anything you want to do\n",
    "- e.g. When clicking a button called \"Function\", a number is multiplied by 2 and subtracted by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toggle Negative/Positive\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a button with \\`data-action=\"neg\"\\` to your HTML.\n",
    "- In the JS event listener, write logic to multiply the current display number by \\`-1\\` and update the display.\n",
    "- Test: Press \\`5\\` then \\`±\\` should show \\`-5\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backspace\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a **DEL** or **←** button to your HTML.\n",
    "- Use the JavaScript string method \\`slice()\\` to remove the last character from \\`display.textContent\\`.\n",
    "- Test: Type \\`123\\` then press **DEL** three times to get back to \\`0\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add colors to the buttons, display numbers, the calculator itself, and change the colors when a button is clicked\n",
    "- Make some buttons bigger than the others, such as the \\`=\\` button or any other button of your choice\n",
    "- Add any other styling of your choice that makes the calculator look unique (the calculator does not have to look realistic)"
