    "This mini-sprint includes three formative assessments followed by a summative review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module requires learners to apply object-based programming concepts within the OCS GameEngine using GameBuilder. Students configure core game objects, define interactions, document implementation decisions, and demonstrate structured version control practices.\n",

    "**Estimated Time** 1 Hour\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use GameBuilder to create a mini game that includes:\n",
    "   - One Background  \n",
    "   - One Player  \n",
    "   - One NPC  \n",
    "   - At least one Barrier  \n",

    "2. In the shared team repository, create a GitHub Issue titled:\n",
    "\n",
    "   `Sprint 1 – Mini Game Configuration`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the Issue, include:\n",
    "   - A brief description of your game concept  \n",
    "   - A list of configured objects and their roles  \n",
    "   - Key configuration decisions (properties, positioning, behavior)\n",

    "4. Export the generated JavaScript configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Commit the file to the shared team repository.\n",
    "   - Each Team member is creating their own level\n",
    "   - Each Level will be named uniquely to co-exist in GameBuilder directory\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Add structured documentation comments (Javadoc-style) explaining:\n",
    "   - The purpose of each object  \n",
    "   - Key property selections  \n",

    "   - One defined interaction (e.g., collision, scoring, trigger event)  \n",
    "   - One observable reaction (e.g., score update, animation, state change)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update your existing GitHub Issue with:\n",
    "   - A description of the interaction logic  \n",
    "   - An explanation of how the reaction is triggered  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Commit updated configuration or script files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add documentation comments explaining:\n",
    "   - Where the interaction occurs in the game loop  \n",
    "   - How object properties update during execution  \n",
