    ">What is **Data Abstraction**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction is a concept in programming that focuses on hiding the full implementation of something with a simpler interface, making this thing reusable and easier to use.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Classes\n",
    "- Abstract classes \n",
    "- Abstract methods\n",
    "- Functions\n",
    "- Much more\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Different types of data abstraction\n",
    "### <u><b>Example #1: Functions</b></u>\n",
    "```\n",
    "function declareWinner(winner){\n",
    "  winnerMsg.textContent = `${winner} Wins!`;\n",
    "  running = false;\n",
    "}\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Take, for example, this function found in the pong game. Inside the curly braces (\"{}\") resides the implementation of the function.\n",
    "Put simply, this function prints out who won the game on screen. Then, it ends the game by setting the \"running\" boolean to false.\n",
    "The part where data abstraction starts is actually in the function declaration; Instead of having to write the code inside the function every time you want to end the game, a function is declared with a parameter called \"winner\".\n",
    "Now, when you want to declare a winner you can simply write:\n",
    "```\n",
    "declareWinner(player1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Note: The variable \"player1\" can be replaced with any other variable that satisfies the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Short:** This is data abstraction due to the fact that the code inside of the function is hidden and instead interfaced with a simple function call.\n",
