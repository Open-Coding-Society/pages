    "## Goal üéØ\n",
    "Add a **calculation history** feature like [Google Chrome's calculator](https://www.google.com/search?q=calculator) that shows recent expressions and their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn \n",
    "By completing this hack, you'll practice:\n",
    "- **Variables**: Storing calculation history data\n",
    "- **Functions**: Creating reusable code to manage history\n",
    "- **DOM Manipulation**: Updating the webpage display\n",
    "- **Arrays**: Managing lists of calculations\n",
    "- **Event Handling**: Responding to user interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hack Summary üìù\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You're Building \n",
    "You'll add a **history panel** to the calculator that:\n",
    "- Saves every calculation you make\n",
    "- Displays them in a list format: `expression = result`\n",
    "- Shows the most recent calculation at the top\n",
    "- Updates automatically after each calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. **Storage**: Use an array to store calculation history\n",
    "2. **Recording**: When user clicks \"=\" button, save the expression and result\n",
    "3. **Display**: Show the history list in a dedicated HTML section\n",
    "4. **Integration**: Connect your history functions to the existing calculator code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task Overview \n",
    "You'll complete 6 TODO items that guide you through:\n",
    "- Creating variables to store history data (TODO-H1)\n",
    "- Writing functions to add and display history (TODO-H2, H3)\n",
    "- Connecting these functions to the calculator's existing code (TODO-H4-H6)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Need to Edit üìÇ\n",
    "### File Location\n",
    "Open `hacks/hack2-calculator.md` and find the `<script>` section with TODO comments (TODO-H1 through TODO-H6)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Run the Starter Code\n",
    "1. Start the local server by running `make` in your terminal\n",
    "2. Open the hack page in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:4500/Calculator-Lesson/hack2calculator\n",
    "3. Test the basic calculator - it should work for simple calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Understand the Current Code \n",
    "Before you start coding, take a moment to explore:\n",
    "- Try some calculations (like `5 + 3`, `12 * 4`)\n",
    "- Notice there's no history feature yet\n",
    "- Look at the calculator layout and buttons\n",
    "- Open `hacks/hack2-calculator.md` to see the code you'll be editing\n",

    "## Requirements & Examples üìã\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement 1: Show Recent History\n",
    "**Goal**: Display the most recent calculations\n",
    "**Example**: After calculating `5 + 3` and `12 * 4`, the history should show:\n",
    "12 * 4 = 48\n",
    "5 + 3 = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement 2: Correct Format\n",
    "**Goal**: Each entry should follow the format: `expression = result`\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- Simple: `7 + 2 = 9`\n",
    "- With decimals: `10 / 3 = 3.333333333333333`\n",
    "- Complex: `5 + 3 * 2 = 11`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement 3: Handle All Operations\n",
    "**Goal**: Work with addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)\n",
    "**Examples to test**:\n",
    "- `15 - 7 = 8`\n",
    "- `3.5 * 2 = 7`\n",
    "- `100 / 4 = 25`\n",
    "\n",
