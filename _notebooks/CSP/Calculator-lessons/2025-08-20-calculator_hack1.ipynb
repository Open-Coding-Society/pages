    "## Guided Activity: Expanding Your Calculator with New Math Operations (Step-by-Step Deep Dive)\n",
    " \n",
    "Let's take a deep dive into making your calculator smarter! We'll add three new math operations: exponent (power), division, and floor division. We'll break everything down into small steps, explain what each part does, and help you understand the code along the way.\n",

    "### Step 1: Understanding the Calculator's Buttons\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 1.1. What are HTML Buttons?\n",
    "In your calculator, each button you see (like numbers or +, -, etc.) is created using HTML. Usually, each button is a `<div>` element with a special class name. For example:\n",
    " \n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"calculator-number\">1</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"calculator-operation\">+</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `class` attribute helps the browser know how to style the button and what kind of button it is (number or operation).\n",
    "- The text inside the `<div>` (like `1` or `+`) is what shows up on the button.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 1.2. Finding the Buttons in Your Code\n",
    "Look for a section in your HTML that has lots of `<div>` elements with classes like `calculator-number` or `calculator-operation`. This is where the buttons are created.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 1.3. Adding New Operation Buttons\n",
    "To add new operations, you need to add new `<div>` elements for each operation you want. For example:\n",
    " \n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"calculator-operation\">/</div> <!-- Division -->\n",
    "<div class=\"calculator-operation\">**</div> <!-- Exponent (Power) -->\n",
    "<div class=\"calculator-operation\">//</div> <!-- Floor Division -->\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `/` will be used for division (like 8 / 2 = 4).\n",
    "- `**` will be used for exponentiation (like 2 ** 3 = 8, which means 2 to the power of 3).\n",
    "- `//` will be used for floor division (like 7 // 2 = 3, which means divide and round down).\n",
    " \n",
    "**Why do we add these?**\n",
    "Adding these buttons lets the user choose these operations when using the calculator.\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "### Step 2: How Buttons Talk to JavaScript\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 2.1. What Happens When You Click a Button?\n",
    "When you click a button, JavaScript code runs to figure out what you clicked and what to do next. This is called an \"event listener.\"\n",
    " \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "numbers.forEach(button => {\n",
    "  button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n",
    "    number(button.textContent);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `numbers` is a list of all the number buttons.\n",
    "- `forEach` goes through each button one by one.\n",
    "- `addEventListener(\"click\", ...)` tells the browser to run some code when the button is clicked.\n",
    "- `button.textContent` gets the text inside the button (like `1`, `2`, etc.).\n",
    "- The `number()` function is called with that value.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 2.2. Making Sure New Buttons Work\n",
    "When you add new operation buttons, you need to make sure your JavaScript code knows about them. Usually, there is a line like:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const operations = document.querySelectorAll(\".calculator-operation\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This finds all the buttons with the class `calculator-operation`.\n",
    "- If you add new operation buttons in HTML, this line will include them automatically!\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 2.3. Handling Button Clicks for Operations\n",
    "There is usually code like:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "operations.forEach(button => {\n",
    "  button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n",
    "    operation(button.textContent);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This means: For every operation button, when it's clicked, call the `operation()` function with the button's text (like `+`, `-`, `/`, `**`, or `//`).\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "### Step 3: Teaching the Calculator New Math\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 3.1. The Calculate Function\n",
    "The calculator has a function (often called `calculate`) that figures out what math to do based on the operation.\n",
    " \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function calculate(first, second) {\n",
    "  let result = 0;\n",
    "  switch (operator) {\n",
    "    case \"+\": result = first + second; break;\n",
    "    case \"-\": result = first - second; break;\n",
    "    case \"*\": result = first * second; break;\n",
    "    case \"/\": result = first / second; break;\n",
    "    // Add new cases here!\n",
    "    default: break;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  return result;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `first` and `second` are the numbers you want to calculate with.\n",
    "- `operator` is the operation (like `+`, `-`, etc.).\n",
    "- `switch` checks which operation to use.\n",
    "- Each `case` is a different operation.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 3.2. Adding New Operations to the Code\n",
    "To add exponentiation and floor division, add new cases:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "case \"**\": result = Math.pow(first, second); break; // Exponentiation\n",
    "case \"//\": result = Math.floor(first / second); break; // Floor Division\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `Math.pow(first, second)` means \"first to the power of second\" (like 2 to the 3rd power is 8).\n",
    "- `Math.floor(first / second)` divides and then rounds down to the nearest whole number.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Why do we use `Math.pow` and `Math.floor`?**\n",
    "- JavaScript doesn't have a built-in `**` or `//` operator for all browsers, so we use these functions to do the math.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 3.3. What Happens When You Press Equals?\n",
    "When you press the equals button, the calculator uses the `calculate` function to get the answer and shows it on the screen.\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "### Step 4: Testing and Debugging\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 4.1. Save and Reload\n",
    "- Save your HTML and JavaScript files.\n",
    "- Reload your calculator in the browser to see your changes.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 4.2. Try Out Each Button\n",
    "- Click the new `/`, `**`, and `//` buttons.\n",
    "- Try different numbers and see if the results are what you expect.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 4.3. If Something Doesn't Work...\n",
    "- Read any error messages in the browser's console (press F12 to open developer tools).\n",
    "- Check your code for typos or missing parts.\n",
    "- Ask for help if you're stuck!\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Challenge:**\n",
    "- Try adding another operation, like a square root or a percent button. What steps would you follow?\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
