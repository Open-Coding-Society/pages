    "- Understand and apply different types of **operators**\n",
    "- Call functions and see how they work in real code\n",

    "## 1. What Are Functions in JavaScript?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help you organize, reuse, and simplify your code. They can accept inputs (called parameters) and return outputs (values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Declaration Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function greet(name) {\n",
    "    return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(greet(\"Alice\")); // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call a function as many times as you want, with different arguments."

    "## Different Ways to Write Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript supports several ways to define functions. Each has its own use case and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function expression assigns a function to a variable. This is useful for passing functions as arguments or storing them in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const square = function(x) {\n",
    "    return x * x;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(square(5)); // Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrow Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax and are commonly used for simple operations or callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(multiply(4, 3)); // Output: 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context, which can be useful in certain situations."

    "Switch statements are great for handling multiple possible values in a readable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nesting Functions: Functions Inside Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define functions inside other functions. These are called nested functions. They help organize code and can access variables from their parent function (closure).\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function outerFunction(x) {\n",
    "  function innerFunction(y) {\n",
    "    return y * 2;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  return innerFunction(x) + 1;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(outerFunction(5)); // Output: 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested functions are useful for breaking down complex logic or creating helper functions that are only needed in a specific scope."

    "## Using Switch Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A `switch` statement lets you run different code depending on the value of a variable or expression. It's cleaner than using many `if...else` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const fruit = \"apple\";\n",
    "switch (fruit) {\n",
    "  case \"apple\":\n",
    "    console.log(\"You chose apple.\");\n",
    "    break;\n",
    "  case \"banana\":\n",
    "    console.log(\"You chose banana.\");\n",
    "    break;\n",
    "  default:\n",
    "    console.log(\"Unknown fruit.\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: You chose apple.\n",
