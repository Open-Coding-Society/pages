    "This question involves a path through a two-dimensional (2D) array of integers, where the path is based on the values of elements in the array. When an element of the 2D array is accessed, the first index is used to specify the row and the second index is used to specify the column. The following `Location` class represents a row and column position in the 2D array.\n",
