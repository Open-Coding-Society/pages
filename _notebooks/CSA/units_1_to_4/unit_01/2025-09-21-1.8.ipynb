    "## Homework Part 3: Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Why is documentation more important in team projects than solo projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is significantly more important in team projects than solo projects for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Sharing**: In team projects, multiple developers need to understand each other's code. Without documentation, team members would have to read through entire implementations to understand what a method does, which is time-consuming and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Onboarding New Members**: When new developers join the team, well-documented code allows them to quickly understand the codebase and start contributing. Without documentation, there's a steep learning curve and heavy reliance on existing team members for explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parallel Development**: Team members often work on different parts of the project simultaneously. Documentation serves as a contract - if I document that my method expects a non-null string and returns a positive integer, other developers can write code that calls my method without waiting for my implementation to be complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maintenance and Debugging**: When bugs arise in team projects, the person fixing the bug might not be the original author. Documentation helps maintainers understand the intended behavior, making it easier to identify where the actual behavior deviates.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Reviews**: Documentation makes code reviews more efficient. Reviewers can quickly understand the intent and validate that the implementation matches the documented behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Preventing Knowledge Silos**: If only one person understands a particular module and they leave the team, undocumented code becomes a major liability. Documentation prevents critical knowledge from being locked in one person's head.\n",
    "\n",
    "While documentation is still valuable in solo projects (especially for your future self), the collaborative nature of team projects makes it essential rather than optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Give an example of when a method SHOULD be documented and when it SHOULD NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When a Method SHOULD be Documented:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A method like this complex validation method should definitely be documented:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/**\n",
    " * Validates and processes a credit card payment with fraud detection.\n",
    " * \n",
    " * Performs multi-step validation including card number verification,\n",
    " * CVV validation, expiration date check, and fraud scoring. If all\n",
    " * checks pass, processes the payment through the payment gateway.\n",
    " *\n",
    " * Preconditions:\n",
    " * - cardNumber must be 16 digits\n",
    " * - cvv must be 3 digits\n",
    " * - expirationDate must be in MM/YY format\n",
    " * - amount must be positive\n",
    " *\n",
    " * Postconditions:\n",
    " * - If successful: payment is processed and transaction ID is returned\n",
    " * - If failed: throws PaymentException with specific error code\n",
    " *\n",
    " * @param cardNumber the 16-digit card number\n",
    " * @param cvv the 3-digit security code\n",
    " * @param expirationDate card expiration in MM/YY format\n",
    " * @param amount the payment amount in dollars\n",
    " * @return transaction ID if payment successful\n",
    " * @throws PaymentException if validation fails or payment is declined\n",
    " */\n",
    "public String processPayment(String cardNumber, String cvv, String expirationDate, double amount)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this needs documentation:**\n",
    "- Complex business logic with multiple validation steps\n",
    "- Has important preconditions that callers must satisfy\n",
    "- Throws exceptions that callers need to handle\n",
    "- Non-obvious algorithm (fraud detection)\n",
    "- Critical functionality where mistakes are costly\n",
    "\n",
    "**When a Method SHOULD NOT be Documented:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple getter/setter methods typically don't need documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public String getName() {\n",
    "    return name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public void setName(String name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this doesn't need documentation:**\n",
    "- Self-explanatory: the method name clearly indicates what it does\n",
    "- No complex logic or edge cases\n",
    "- No preconditions or postconditions to specify\n",
    "- Standard Java convention that all developers understand\n",
    "- Adding documentation would just clutter the code without adding value\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Rule of Thumb:**\n",
    "- Document when: The method has complex logic, non-obvious behavior, important preconditions/postconditions, throws exceptions, or when the name alone doesn't fully convey what it does\n",
    "- Don't document when: The method is trivial, self-explanatory, and follows standard conventions (like simple getters/setters)\n"

    "##  Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Documentation is communication** - Write for others (and your future self)\n",
    "2. **Javadoc format matters** - Use `/** */` with proper tags\n",
    "3. **Preconditions and postconditions create contracts** - Essential for reliable code\n",
    "4. **Balance is key** - Don't over-document obvious code, but thoroughly document complex logic\n",
    "5. **Keep it updated** - Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation\n",
    "6. **AP Exam success** - Good documentation demonstrates programming maturity on FRQs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember:\n",
    "> \"Code tells you HOW, documentation tells you WHY\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The collaborative mindset:** Write documentation that you would want to find when using someone else's code. Be specific, be helpful, and anticipate questions.\n",
