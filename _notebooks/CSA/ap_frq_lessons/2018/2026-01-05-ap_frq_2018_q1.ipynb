    "# AP Computer Science A - 2018 FRQ Question 1: Frog Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves simulating the behavior of a frog attempting to reach a goal distance by hopping. The frog may hop forward or backward, and the simulation tracks whether the frog successfully reaches or passes the goal within a maximum number of hops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FrogSimulation` class simulates a frog jumping toward a goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`goalDistance`**: The minimum distance (in inches) the frog must reach to succeed. This is a positive integer representing the target position.\n",
    "- **`maxHops`**: The maximum number of hops allowed in a single simulation. If the frog doesn't reach the goal within this number of hops, the simulation fails.\n",
    "- **`hopDistance()`**: A private method that returns an integer representing the distance (in inches) of a single hop. This value can be positive (forward), negative (backward), or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`simulate()`**: Simulates a single frog attempting to reach the goal.\n",
    "2. **`runSimulations(int num)`**: Runs multiple simulations and calculates the proportion of successful attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part (a): `simulate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Signature:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public boolean simulate()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "Simulates a single attempt by the frog to reach or pass the `goalDistance` within `maxHops` hops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return Value:**\n",
    "- `true` if the frog reaches or passes the `goalDistance` before taking more than `maxHops` hops **and** without landing in a negative position.\n",
    "- `false` if:\n",
    "  - The frog lands in a negative position (position < 0), OR\n",
    "  - The frog does not reach the `goalDistance` within `maxHops` hops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "1. Start the frog at position 0.\n",
    "2. Loop up to `maxHops` times:\n",
    "   - Call `hopDistance()` to get the distance of the current hop.\n",
    "   - Update the frog's position.\n",
    "   - **Immediately check** if the frog has landed in a negative position. If so, return `false`.\n",
    "   - **Immediately check** if the frog has reached or passed `goalDistance`. If so, return `true`.\n",
    "3. If the loop completes without reaching the goal, return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge Cases:**\n",
    "- If the frog lands at exactly `goalDistance`, return `true`.\n",
    "- If the frog lands past `goalDistance` (e.g., goal is 24, position becomes 26), return `true`.\n",
    "- A negative position immediately ends the simulation with failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part (b): `runSimulations(int num)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Signature:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public double runSimulations(int num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "Runs the simulation `num` times and calculates the proportion of successful simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `num`: The number of simulations to run. This is a positive integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return Value:**\n",
    "- A `double` representing the proportion of successful simulations. This is calculated as:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  (number of successful simulations) / (total number of simulations)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Details:**\n",
    "1. Initialize a counter to track successful simulations.\n",
    "2. Loop `num` times:\n",
    "   - Call `simulate()` for each attempt.\n",
    "   - If `simulate()` returns `true`, increment the success counter.\n",
    "3. Calculate and return the proportion: `(double) successes / num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- You must cast to `double` to avoid integer division.\n",
    "- The result should be a decimal value between 0.0 and 1.0.\n",
    "- Example: If 4 out of 10 simulations succeed, return `0.4`.\n",
    "\n",

    "When you run the Java code cell above, you will see two lines of output:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A single simulation result\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   Single simulation success: true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   or\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   Single simulation success: false\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This line shows the result of **one call** to `simulate()` using\n",
    "     `goalDistance = 24` and `maxHops = 5`.\n",
    "   - Because `hopDistance()` uses random values, the result may be `true`\n",
    "     or `false` on different runs.\n",
    "   - A result of `true` means that in this particular run, the frog\n",
    "     reached or passed the goal without ever going negative.\n",
    "   - A result of `false` means that the frog either went negative at some\n",
    "     point or failed to reach the goal within `maxHops` hops.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A proportion of successful simulations\n",
    "\n",

    "   Proportion successful in 1000 runs: 0.37\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This line shows the result of `runSimulations(1000)`.\n",
    "   - The method calls `simulate()` 1000 times, counts the number of\n",
    "     successful simulations, and returns the **proportion of successes**\n",
    "     as a `double`.\n",
    "   - The value will typically fall between 0.0 and 1.0 (for example,\n",
    "     `0.37` means 37% of the simulations were successful).\n",

    "### How This Output Supports Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **single simulation output** confirms that `simulate()` correctly\n",
    "  returns a `boolean` result based on the frog's path.\n",
    "- The **proportion output** confirms that `runSimulations(int num)`\n",
    "  correctly:\n",
    "  - Calls `simulate()` exactly `num` times,\n",
    "  - Counts only the successful runs, and\n",
    "  - Uses `(double) successes / num` to compute the final proportion.\n",

    "#### Mistake 2: Using `==` Instead of `>=` for Goal Check\n",

    "if (position == goalDistance) {\n",
    "    return true;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "The frog can pass the goal (e.g., land at position 26 when goal is 24). Using `==` would miss this case. The correct comparison is `position >= goalDistance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mistake 3: Not Returning Immediately\n",
    "**Incorrect:**\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It's Wrong:**  \n",

    "### General Tips to Avoid These Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the problem carefully**: Pay attention to return types, parameter types, and exact requirements.\n",
    "2. **Check conditions inside loops**: For simulations that can end early, checks must happen after each iteration.\n",
    "3. **Use correct comparison operators**: Know when to use `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, etc.\n",
    "4. **Cast for floating-point division**: When dividing integers to get a decimal result, cast at least one operand to `double`.\n",
    "5. **Return immediately when conditions are met**: Don't store results in variables and continue processing unnecessarily.\n",
    "6. **Test edge cases**: Consider boundary values like position 0, exactly reaching the goal, and negative positions.\n",
    "7. **Follow method signatures exactly**: Match return types, parameter types, and method names precisely as specified.\n",
