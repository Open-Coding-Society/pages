# JavaScript Section

### Purpose

Considering you're on this section, you likely have learned that HTML is what structures website. CSS is what styles and add a design to websites. JavaScript add to this list: It makes the website interactive.

### Syntax

### Variables

Variables are essentially how data is stored in usable containers in code.

There are 4 ways this can be done, but only two are recommended.

The first of these methods is **let**. It allows the variable to be changed after it is defined:

`let x = 5;`

The second of these methods is **const**. After the variable is defined, it cannot be changed:

`const x = 5;`

### Operators

Mathematical operators are often used in JavaScript and other programming languages. Below is a list of a handful of operators:

Addition operator:

```
let x = 5;
let y = 3;

let z = x + y

// z will output 8
console.log(z);
```

Subtraction operator:

```
let x = 5;
let y = 3;

let z = x - y;

// z will output 3
console.log(z);
```

Multiplication operator:

```
let x = 5;
let y = 2;

let z = x * y;

// z will output 10
console.log(z);

```

Division operator:

```
let x = 10;
let y = 2;

// z will output 20
console.log(z);
```
